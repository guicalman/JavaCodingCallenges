## Bank Applicatin using Java Array Class

Your job is to create a simple banking application.
1. There should be a Bank class
2. It should have an arraylist of Branches
3. Each Branch should have an arraylist of Customers
4. The Customer class should have an arraylist of Doubles (transactions)
Customer:
    - Name, and the ArrayList of doubles.
    - Branch:
        - Need to be able to add a new customer and initial transaction amount.
        - Also needs to add additional transactions for that customer/branch
5. Bank:
    - Add a new branch
    - Add a customer to that branch with initial transaction
    - Add a transaction for an existing customer for that branch
    - Show a list of customers for a particular branch and optionally a list
of their transactions
6. Demonstration autoboxing and unboxing in your code
*Hint: Transactions*
7. Add data validation.
e.g. check if exists, or does not exist, etc.
8. Think about where you are adding the code to perform certain actions
